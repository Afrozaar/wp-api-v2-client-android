# README # 

This is an android WordPress library. It uses the rest parameters and models from [WP Rest Api](http://wp-api.org/). This library follows roughly the same processes and format as the [Java WordPress library](https://github.com/Afrozaar/wp-api-v2-client-java) except the Java 8 has been stripped out and the network calls handled asynchronously to avoid [Network calls made on Main thread exception](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/NetworkOnMainThreadException.html)
